# Bike Share Toronto Availability Dashboard

  Visit [here](https://fraser-evans.shinyapps.io/bikesharedashboard/) for the dashboard!

  Dock and bike availability for 880 Bike Share Toronto stations, both live and over the last 24 hours

  Availability is queried every ~10 minutes from [here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto), or every 60 seconds when the dashboard is live, using an automated Python script found [here](https://github.com/fraserevans/Data-Visualizations/blob/main/BikeShareTO/query_bikeshare.py).
